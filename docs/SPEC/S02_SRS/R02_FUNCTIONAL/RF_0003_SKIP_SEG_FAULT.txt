@desc
Test case is a software. Therefore, it can be buggy and a segmentation 
fault occurs. Even so, it is very unfortune if we cannot run all test
cases. Generally running all test cases take at least a few minutes 
or several hours. So, the developers are away after running the test.
To be more convenient, the SATES shall skip a test case even if the
test software makes segmentation fault.
